# Solar Potential Analysis (Multi-City Project)

### Team Goal
Estimate rooftop solar potential across ~31 global cities using open NEO datasets and machine learning models.

## Repo Overview
| Folder | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| `data_standardization/` | Scripts and setup for dataset cleaning |
| `cleaned_datasets/` | Team-uploaded standardized city CSVs |
| `individual_EDA/` | EDA notebooks per city |
| `merged_data/` | (Later) merged master dataset |

---

### Next Steps
- Everyone runs `standardize_solar_data.py` locally.
- Push the cleaned file (e.g., `antigua.csv`) into `cleaned_datasets/`.
- Push the original file (e.g, `antigua_rooftop_solarpotential.csv`) into `original_datasets/`.
- Push your individual EDA noteboks into `individual_EDA/`.
- Once all are collected, the merging and baseline modeling will begin.
